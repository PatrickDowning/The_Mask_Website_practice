			The Mask is a 1994 American musical superhero comedy film directed by Charles Russell,
			 produced by Bob Engelman, and written by Mike Werb, loosely based on the Mask comics 
			 published by Dark Horse Comics. The first installment in the Mask franchise, it stars
			  Jim Carrey in the title role, Peter Riegert, Peter Greene, Amy Yasbeck, Richard Jeni, 
			  and Cameron Diaz in her film debut. Carrey plays Stanley Ipkiss, a hapless, everyday 
			  bank clerk who finds a magical mask that transforms him into The Mask, a cartoonish, 
			  mischievous, genuine insane, green-faced troublemaker with the ability to cartoonishly 
			  alter himself and his surroundings at will who later on becomes a crimefighter, only to become 
			  targeted by gangster Dorian Tyrell, who intends to use the mask to overthrow his superior.
